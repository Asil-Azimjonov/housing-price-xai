# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction with Explainable AI (SHAP)

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict housing prices — and, more importantly, how we can **explain** these predictions using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). By combining predictive modeling with interpretability, this project shows how AI models can move from black-box to transparent decision-making.


## 📌 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Predict house sale prices using machine learning and explain the model’s decision-making process.
- **Core Techniques**: Regression Modeling, SHAP for Explainability.
- **Key Question**: *Can we trust the model’s predictions, and can we understand what drives them?*

## 💡 Why It Matters

In many high-stakes industries like real estate, finance, and healthcare, **model transparency** is just as important as performance. This project addresses that by:
- Predicting prices accurately,
- Revealing how features like square footage, location, or quality drive those predictions,
- Making the model interpretable to non-technical stakeholders.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**:
   
2. **Model Training**:
   - Hyperparameter tuning 
   - Final Model: Gradient Boosting Regressor (XGBoost)

3. **Explainability with SHAP**:
   - Global importance of features
   - Local explanations for individual predictions
